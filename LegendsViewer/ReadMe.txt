Using Legends Viewer
	General
		-CTRL+Click on any links, lists, or buttons opens pages in a new tab.
	Searching
		-Each tab has various options for sorting and filtering.
		-Every tab has the sub tab "Events" letting you filter events from event logs.
		-The "Filtered Events" Sort is used in conjunction with the Events Tab which allows for some custom sorting.
		-"Filter All Unimportant Warfare" in the Wars Tab removes unnotable battles and pillagings from battle lists in all pages.
		-Some lists in pages can be loaded for searching by clicking "[Load]" next to the list heading.
	Map
		-Click & Drag moves the map.
		-Mouse Wheel to zoom in / out.
		-Civs & Sites can be toggled with options above the minimap.
		-CTRL + Mouse Wheel changes year of the map by 1 year.
		-SHIFT + Mouse Wheel changes year of the map by 10 years.
		-CTRL + SHIFT + Mouse Wheel changes year of the map by 100 years.
	Advanced Search
		-Searching Sub Lists 
			Example: Searching historical figure's kills. 
			If you want to see historical figures with kills > 10 just leave the sub options blank. 
			If you want to see historical figures that killed an elf then you can select Kills > Race > Equals > Elf. 
			If you want to see who killed the most elves you do the same with Order Criteria.
		-Selecting - Selecting is used to search and return results from sub lists. 
			So if you want to search through a specific historical figure's kills, you Historical Figures > Kills, then in the Select Criteria select Name > Equals > "Urist McDwarf". 
			That will return all of Urist McDwarf's kills, then you can add Search/Order Criteria to look through them more.
		-Guided Searches - When selecting values to search by it will generate all the available options. 
			So if you search for Dwarves and then add a criteria for caste it will show you all the castes of dwarves in the drop down box.
		-Order (Min/Max/Sum/Avg) - You can do Min/Max/Sum/Avg when ordering by sub sub options.
			So if you want to find historical figures that participated in the most bloody battles you can order by Battles > Deaths > Sum > Descending. 
			These options can be a little slow sometimes, limiting the results to sort can speed it up.
		
Things to note:
	- XML dump is incomplete! Anywhere that there are details left out I noted with "UNKNOWN" however if you see "INVALID" any then its a bug that needs to be fixed.
	- Duplicate Historical Figures / Entities in summary log indicate that relations for duplicates may not be setup properly you will have to check History/Site files to view these relations.
	- Bigger worlds will perform slower. Some pages with a lot of activity can take a few seconds to load. Be careful in the Era tab with events and era length, all events are filtered out by default. Selecting too many events and a lengthy era can result in GBs of memory being used and can take some time to generate the page.
	- Requires .NET 4 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&displaylang=en)

Archive Support 
	-Tested with (zip/7zip/rar)
	-Must have these files in the archive
		-XML file
		-history file ending with "-world_history.txt"
		-sites and populations file ending with "-world_sites_and_pops.txt"
		-Map Image files (bmp/png/jpg/jpeg)
	-Any other files in the archive will be ignored without error.	
	
Troubleshooting
	-If images aren't showing up in pages or navigating pages doesn't work try updating Internet Explorer to a newer version. IE7 and up should work.
	-If you encouter errors while loading files, first try restarting Dwarf Fortress and re-export all the files. If it still happens after that you can send me your files or world gen parameters and I will look into it.
